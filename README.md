# Tiktok Mass Downloader
Simple script to mass download tiktok video without watermark, used node js + puppeteer

That script only does one thing if you want many downloads options consider looking at [Xsrazy](https://xsrazy.github.io/)
- TMD script mass downloads all tiktok videos of a single user profileand the descriptions.
- Adding number after url argument mass downloads number of tiktok videos of a single user and the descriptions.

Note: Videos are stored in @username folder whereas the description is stored in names.txt

Warning: Since the script mass downloads, it can be alot of data depending on the number you enter or the number of videos a user has. 

# requirements:
+ Node Js

# Installtion:
After installing Node Js

+ git clone https://github.com/xsrazy/Tiktok-Mass-Downloader

Or

Of course you can change the username xsrazy to whatever user you want 
to download all videos of single user.
